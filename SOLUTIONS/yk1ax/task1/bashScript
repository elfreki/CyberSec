/*
A wordlist was to be created so a tool like crunch is used
It's syntax is

crunch minvalue maxvalue [characters whose permutations are formed] [additional flags for adding specific functionalities to the wordlist]

here I used 't' and 'o' options
't' determines the pattern for the wordlist in which we enter the string in which the permutations are to be embedded and further four options are available
@ , % ^ Here only @ is used which is for lowercase letters
'o' specifies the output functionalities

When I used 6 letters for permutation the size of the file created was 2.2mb while for 8 letters it was 12.6mb so I took 7 letters for which the size
 of the file was 5.6mb as we need it to be between 4mb and 8mb

There is an alternate solution for which we can also take more than 7 letters and still limit the size
We will use another option 'b' in which we can specify the maximum size --> -b 7mb
It will make two files first one with the specified size and the other one with the rest entries of the wordlist
Here we have to use another option '-o START' after the 'b' option
I wasn't able to store it directly into a file with the name welcome.sh so renaming the file, amongst the two files, with the desired size was needed
The complete script would be :

crunch 47 47 abcdefgsdfhdsf -t "I am the flag : ACTF{@@@@@@}You are confused :)" -b 7mb -o START

/*
Here 'sed' command is used which stands for Stream EDitor and it is a tool which can be used for replacing text
It's syntax is :
sed '[operations]' file
under '' we insert the operations
's/old/new/g'
s --> it is for substitution
old --> is the text that is to be replaced
new --> is the text that old is to be replaced with
g --> it stands for global so that all occurences of old are replaced with new
and ; is used so that multiple suubstitution operations can be done in the same command
Input file is specified after writing the operations
At the end I wrote '> file_1.txt' so that the output of the command is stored in a file named file_1.txt
